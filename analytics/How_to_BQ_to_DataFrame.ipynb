As part of the team responsible for creating training datasets and evaluating models after they've been trained, Betterview's Data Scientist has many talents related to data collection and model validation on a large scale. If Betterview is looking for more imagery wherein solar panels are on a roof, the Data Scientist is responsible for finding and creating a dataset where every image in the dataset contains a clean example of solar panels. If Betterview is releasing a new model for identifying tarps, the Data Scientist evaluates the available trained model options and selects a candidate for release based on key performance metrics. To accomplish these tasks at scale, the Data Scientist should have automation, scripting, and SQL in their tool kit.\n",
